        <p className='bold'>Why soy candles?</p>
        <br />
        <p>We use 100% soy wax in our candles, which is plant-based and is non-toxic, all natural and sustainable. Candles made from soy wax burn cleaner resulting in less soot (less indoor pollution), and do not emit harmful toxins, which is better for air quality and your overall health. </p>
        <br />
        <p className='bold'>How long do your candles last?</p>
        <br />
        <p>10 oz soy wax candles have a burn time of approximately 50-60 hours. Soy wax burns slower and tends to hold scent better than paraffin wax, so you get a candle that lasts longer and is non-toxic.</p>
        <br />
        <p className='bold'>How do I clean up spillage if it happens?</p>
        <br />
        <p>Soy wax cleans off of almost any surface with a simple solution of warm, soapy water. </p>
        <br />
        <p className="bold">What if I have trouble lighting my candle?</p>
        <br />
        <p>Wood wicks typically need to be trimmed at a 3mm length for easy lighting. This shorter wick length allows for the melted wax to feed the flame easily. If the wood wick is too long, simply trim with a wick trimmer, a nail cutter or scissor, or pinch with your fingers.</p>
